Sentiment analysis is useful for companies to know what their buyers think about their products. This is called customer feedback. 
This type of analysis is very useful especially for e-business companies because they have a large volume of data that allows them to take corrective actions in their 
business before the consequences are irreverable (massive loss of customers). Customer feedback could also be used to obtain information useful for innovation, 
development of new products or improvement of products. Ignoring is bad for business.
